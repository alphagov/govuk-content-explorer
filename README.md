# GOVUK Content Explorer

This tool is intended to help explore the content on GOV.UK, allowing it to be
segmented by section, topic, organisation, format and other tags.

It gathers its data from the GOV.UK search API, so it's view of what's on
GOV.UK is based on what is in the search index.  This is reasonably
comprehensive, but not 100% accurate.
